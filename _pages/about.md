I am a third year PhD Student in the Earth and Environmental Engineering Department at Columbia University in the City of New York. My advisor is Prof. Upmanu Lall and I work at the Columbia Water Center. My research interests are in Water Resources with a focus on Climate Risk. My past research has been on Mining, Water Pollutions and their interaction with local communities.
