I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Earth and Environmental Engineering department at Columbia University in the City of New York.
My dissertation is focused on understanding spatiotemporal climate risk to water and energy infrastructure systems at a regional level. 
My current research interests also include the renewable energy transition and understanding interannual hydroclimatic variability, along with a focus on climate risk. 
My past research has been on mining, water pollution, and their interactions with local communities. 
I am advised by Prof. Upmanu Lall and work at the Columbia Water Center (CWC), a research center within the Earth Institute.

An updated record of my publications along my CV is linked below.

In my free time, I explore all that New York City offers. You can find me catching the latest off-Broadway shows or sipping coffee in Central Park.
